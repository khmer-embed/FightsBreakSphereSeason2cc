00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.400
Elder Hao.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.290
Excuse me, excuse me.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.270
- Excuse me.
- This is yours.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.340
Thank you.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.100
Thank you, Elder Hao.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:37.860
Excuse me, excuse me.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.060
Excuse me.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.260
I, Xiao Yan,

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.330
apply for
Fire and Ice Dragon Beard Fruit.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.900
You want

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.610
Fire and Ice Dragon Beard Fruit?

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.180
Please approve, Elder Hao.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.980
Three thousand fire energy points.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.650
- What...
- Three thousand?

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.820
Are you kidding?

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.220
It's okay, I'll go back and get it.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.540
We don't have any fire energy points.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.930
Then stop causing trouble here.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.060
Step aside.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.530
I don't understand.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.970
Why do we have to pay

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.660
extra fire energy points

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.660
when we've already paid our tuition?

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:20.540
Am I right?

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.610
Yeah, why?

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.890
That makes sense.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.780
Where do these

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.090
fire energy points flow to?

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.890
Elder Hao, please tell us.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:33.670
So you are not

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.380
here for the herbs,

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.730
you are here to settle accounts.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.170
Okay,

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.420
let's settle accounts then.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.500
The annual fee for each student

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.690
is 5,000 fire energy points.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.610
Deducting living expenses

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.580
and maintenance costs leaves a balance

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.220
of 2,000 fire energy points.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.810
Adding the consumption of materials
for cultivation,

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.250
which is 1,500
fire energy points at least,

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:59.730
and plus

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.970
heating in winter,

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.140
cooling in summer,

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.530
mountain forest maintenance,

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.780
and the monthly payment for caretakers,

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.090
it adds up to 2,000

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.610
fire energy points
owed by you to the Academy.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.380
Elder Hao, I think...

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.220
Let me finish.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.940
And you, Xiao Yan,
are different from others.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.610
During my class,

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.300
you destroyed my jade pill furnace.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.370
I'll give you a discount,

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.530
500 fire energy points.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.250
Also, for the items you destroyed
during the Grand Competition,

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.500
let me calculate.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.090
Hey,

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.940
how can you steal Elder Hao's
medicinal ingredients?

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:43.810
Who's that?

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.730
It's easy if you want
to enter the Medicine Forest.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.060
I'll use the name of the Gu Clan

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.300
to negotiate with the elders.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.450
And then I can take you there.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.330
We cannot let the elders know about this.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:01.780
Why?

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:03.970
Why?

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.330
Because this matter is...

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:08.660
You are doing this for Xiao Yan?

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.140
Anyway, can you help me

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.580
get Elder Hu Qian's token?

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.260
You want to sneak into
the Medicine Forest?

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.130
Got you!

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.330
Will you surrender obediently

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.010
or come with me
to find the elders and explain?

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:32.690
Miss,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.850
I don't think you are my opponent.

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.780
Of course, I'm not your opponent.

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.700
I'm your accomplice.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:43.660
Accomplice?

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:45.410
You see,

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.060
now that I know your secret,

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.340
and

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.380
I'm going to help you

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.010
steal that token.

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:54.130
So,

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.700
aren't we accomplices?

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:58.780
Miss, are you willing to help me?

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:02.290
Think about it.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.700
On a dark night,

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.330
you and I fly over rooftops,
and fight side by side.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.170
Doesn't it sound exciting?

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.780
- Since it's the case, then...
- Shh...

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.100
Keep it down.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:30.730
Since we can use the main gate,

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.100
why this disguise?

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.820
If we want to be thieves,
we should look like them,

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:38.450
and besides,

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.010
don't you like the feeling

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.170
of we fighting in unified uniform?

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:52.820
Elder Hu Qian is sleeping pretty soundly.

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.500
He usually wakes up every one hour.

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:56.450
How do you know?

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:58.610
He's my grandfather.

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:59.730
I know him well.

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.100
Now, let's get to work.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.610
You go find, and I'll keep watch here.

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:18.780
Go.

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.570
Which one is it?

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:56.850
I haven't seen it.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.570
Do you know what the token looks like?

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:02.290
I have never seen it.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:04.130
Such an important item

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:05.500
wouldn't be left out in the open.

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:07.450
It should be carried on the person.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:10.250
That makes sense.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:18.340
I got nothing.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:34.340
Have you found it?

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:39.660
Hu Jia.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.330
There's a token.

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:48.010
Elder Hu.

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:52.500
Elder Hu?

00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:58.850
Elder Hu.

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:01.260
Have you gone to bed?

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:03.890
Tonight, we should

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:07.330
guard the Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower
together.

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:11.380
Elder Hu?

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:37.370
That was close.

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:38.940
He had to go there

00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:40.340
at that critical moment.

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:42.140
Luckily, we got out in time.

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:45.050
Miss Hu Jia,

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:46.700
please give me the token.

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:51.260
I have forgotten to take it out.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:52.100
What?

00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:58.530
I've never seen you like this.

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:01.340
Miss Hu Jia, please don't joke about this.

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:04.610
I did that on purpose.

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.820
I don't think even Xun'er
has ever seen you like that.

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:12.820
If I give you the token,

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:15.610
I'll become useless to you,

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:16.780
right?

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:20.140
You helped me a lot today,
and I'm very grateful.

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:23.460
I don't need your gratitude.

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:25.130
Just remember,

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:26.940
you owe me a favor.

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:30.570
Miss Hu Jia,

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.060
aren't you going to ask me
what I want to do with it?

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:35.730
That's your business.

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:37.170
I've done

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:38.650
what I needed to do.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:39.980
It's getting late.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.100
Be careful.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:43.580
I will be careful.

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:14.770
Thank you for today.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:16.530
Give me the token,

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:17.970
and you can go back now.

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:19.220
I'm also going in.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:21.770
More people means a bigger target.

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:23.290
You better leave now.

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.610
Just do what you need to do.

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:27.730
This token can only be used for an hour.

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:30.090
You must come out in an hour.

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:31.180
Understand?

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.260
Of course, I understand.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.140
It was stolen by you,
so you are the boss.

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:36.060
What do you mean by "stolen"?

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:37.250
Stop talking.

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:38.850
It will close in an hour.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:39.900
Hurry and go in.

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:51.940
Your Highness.

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:55.850
A decisive man like him

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:57.820
is quite charming.

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:01.540
Are you surprised?

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:02.900
What...

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.940
How can you act on your own?

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:07.420
You brat,

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:10.610
you are in no place to command me.

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:14.340
What if your identity is exposed?

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:15.450
Lower your voice.

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:19.610
It's just past midnight,

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:20.900
maybe many people are still awake.

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:23.410
Should I call them over

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:25.060
to see who is doing

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:26.460
something sneaky here?

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:28.650
What benefit do you get

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.090
from doing this?

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:34.180
None.

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:36.700
I just want you to learn a lesson

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:38.850
because you didn't

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.340
take my matter seriously.

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:46.770
I never said I wouldn't refine
the Thawing Spirit Pill for you.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:48.900
But I need to save my brother first.

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:50.780
There are many medicinal materials here.

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:52.000
Some can save your brother,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.610
and some can refine
the Thawing Spirit Pill.

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:55.770
Now go, find them for me.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:59.610
Is this how you ask for help?

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:01.050
Cut the nonsense.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:17.900
This is the Academy's elixir room.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:12:59.770
There's a strange Dou Qi aura.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:02.460
That way...

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:05.100
The Medicine Forest!

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:16.100
Here, take this.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:17.210
Sprinkle it along the way.

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:19.610
Am I your servant?

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:46.090
What's the point of sprinkling this?

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:47.900
This pill

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:50.460
will make the Fire and Ice
Dragon Beard Fruit react.

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:03.260
Fire and Ice Dragon Beard Fruit?

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:24.610
There's really something wrong.

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:31.740
Halt!

00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:42.940
What a strange Dou Qi.

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:44.460
Who are you?

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:07.340
Be careful.

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:13.530
Quickly, go after them!

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:14.450
Watch out for ambushes.

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:16.090
Xiao Yan is still inside!

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:07.450
What beautiful eyes.

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:08.870
You're not human either?

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:10.970
Of course I'm not human.

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:13.410
I'm the Queen
of the Serpent Kingdom.

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:17.530
Miss Queen.

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:19.260
Miss. Miss. Miss.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:20.100
Stop.

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:22.770
I'm not close to you.

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:29.260
She's a dragon.

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.170
She probably took the morphing herb

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:32.970
and can change her form at will.

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:35.690
Kid.

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:38.170
Are you staying here alone?

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:40.020
Old man Hao let me stay here.

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:42.290
He said I could eat
whatever I wanted.

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:47.530
So you're the monster
in the Medicine Forest

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:49.210
that everyone talked about.

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:50.820
I'm not a monster.

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:53.900
I'm the Ancient Dragon of Taixu.

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:56.820
The big three Magic Beast families.

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:02.980
No!

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:07.410
Let me.

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:11.090
Kid.

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:13.290
This doesn't taste good.

00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:14.580
Put it down.

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:15.770
No way.

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:17.580
How can I grow up if I don't eat?

00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:19.340
I'll give you something in exchange.

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:22.460
Old man Hao doesn't allow me

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:24.530
to eat anything from strangers.

00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:26.170
I'm not a bad person.

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:28.540
Ask her.

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:31.340
I doubt it.

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:40.090
Little girl.

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:42.060
You are really strong.

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:52.530
You've got to do it harder. It's fun.

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:56.010
I lost.

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:00.290
You don't want to play anymore?

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:02.460
Since I've lost,

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:04.060
you can have
the Fire and Ice Dragon Beard Fruit.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.530
I was going to trade you

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:09.130
for the world's most delicious elixir.

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:10.700
I don't think

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:12.580
we'll get the chance. Maybe next time.

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:13.820
Give it to me.

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:17.980
Shame on you!

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:23.980
Give me the Fire and Ice
Dragon Beard Fruit first.

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:26.100
Give me the elixir first.

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:34.370
All for you.

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:37.370
So many.

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:40.530
What about the Fire and Ice
Dragon Beard Fruit?

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:46.860
It tastes good.

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:48.770
Easy.

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:50.980
You'll have problems
if you eat that much.

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:52.770
I don't care.

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:54.460
My father told me

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:56.290
I have to grow up fast to see him.

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:58.580
So I have to eat more
and grow up faster.

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:00.650
Who's your father?

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:03.010
My father is just my father.

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:04.940
But

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:06.060
my father doesn't like you humans

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:07.340
as much as I do.

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:08.890
You are always screaming

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:11.820
when you see us.

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:12.970
It's annoying.

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:14.770
But

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:16.890
you're not like them.

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:18.700
What's your name?

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:20.650
Just call me Xiao Yan.

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:23.090
Xiao Yan?

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:25.250
I've memorized it.

00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:28.100
My name is Zi Yan.

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:30.250
I'll come back for you
when I'm hungry.

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:33.420
Zi Yan?

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.460
I think I've heard that name
somewhere before.

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:46.100
The first place
of Strong Ranking Grand Competition.

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:49.220
Your Highness, wait for me.

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:54.510
Zi Yan is the first place
of Strong Ranking Grand Competition.

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:57.100
The first place is a dragon,
not a human,

00:19:58.250 --> 00:19:59.490
and even an Ancient Dragon of Taixu.

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:04.540
Xun'er.

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:06.650
Why are you together?

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:10.100
Why are you together?

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:11.940
Was there anyone suspicious

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:13.340
in the Medicine Forest?

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:17.570
Does it have anything to do with you?

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:19.250
This is not the time for such nonsense.

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:20.920
There's something wrong
with the Medicine Forest.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.490
You'd better leave
and never come back.

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:23.540
- I…
- Gu Yao is right.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:24.980
The boundary's been breached.

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:26.460
The elders will know soon.

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:30.410
Xun'er, why are you
always defending him?

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:31.580
Come on.

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:32.900
Let's split up.

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:36.490
Xiao Yan, you should
go back to your dormitory.

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:48.980
What a perfect match.

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:50.130
Right?

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:53.940
It's because you messed up.

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:55.650
You ungrateful person.

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.100
You don't realize
I'm trying to help you.

00:20:58.170 --> 00:20:59.580
You call that helping me?

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:02.250
Let me ask you.

00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:04.100
Was that girl angry when she left?

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:06.220
Of course she was.

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:10.530
It's a good thing

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:12.090
she's angry.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:13.860
If she isn't,

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:16.100
you're done.

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:19.650
There's not that much going on
between Xun'er and me.

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:21.530
You're pretty confident.

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:24.540
Whatever.

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:44.130
Leave.

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:45.060
Don't look back.

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:55.820
This kid looks like Xiao Yan.

00:21:58.490 --> 00:21:59.860
He must be Xiao Yan.

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:02.940
He asked me for the Ice and Fire
Dragon Beard Fruit during the day

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:04.700
and came to the Medicine Forest
at night.

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:07.840
There's something wrong with him.

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:09.370
Yes.

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:11.820
I...

00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:13.850
It dropped.

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:21.980
We'll have to take a closer look later.

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:45.780
Mr. Yao.

00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:48.740
Something is wrong with you today.

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:51.580
Things are getting
more and more complicated.

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:54.370
If I'm right,

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:56.530
Jia Nan Academy is being targeted.

00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:58.780
What do you mean?

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:02.860
I didn't realize the filth was back.

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:05.770
Filth? What filth?

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:08.490
It's a bunch of ghosts in human skin.

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:11.620
On Dou Qi Continent,

00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:14.530
only they would use
the most cruel of means

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:15.700
to make themselves stronger.

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:19.010
They suck the Dou Qi
of the living for their own cultivation.

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:20.770
They kill and suck blood

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:21.980
and do everything evil.

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:24.370
Who are you talking about?

00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:30.610
The Hall of Souls.

00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:40.370
Gu Yao, go back first.

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:41.610
Here I am.

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:43.940
Are you afraid Xiao Yan
will see the injury on your hand?

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:49.580
I brought medicine from the Gu Clan.

00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:51.440
At least it will help you
get better faster.

00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:58.650
Tell me if it hurts.

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.580
Did you want to go into
the Medicine Forest before

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:09.650
to find out
about the weirdness tonight?

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:11.490
Yes.

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:15.250
What's your mission here
at Jia Nan Academy?

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:17.410
To bring you back.

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:19.820
What else?

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:22.890
So you stay at Jia Nan Academy

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:24.410
because of some mission of the Gu Clan?

00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:28.860
The Xiao Clan has
an ancestral ancient jade

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:30.290
related to the Gu Clan.

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:34.250
My father told me to use
the power of my bloodline

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:36.510
to guard the Xiao Clan's ancient jade
from being coveted by outsiders.

00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:38.650
This is the task of the Gu Clan for me.

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:45.250
This is Ancient Jade Token.

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:47.820
When I first got to the Xiao Clan,

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:49.820
my father told me
to perceive the ancient jade with it.

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:52.490
Now this ancient jade

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:54.170
is most likely in Xiao Yan's possession.

00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:55.620
So

00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:58.010
I will not leave him.

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:01.620
An ancient jade related to the Gu Clan...

00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:05.620
I've said all I have to say.

00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:06.900
What about you?

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:10.340
Do you know
about the Hall of Souls?

00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:14.130
The Hall of Souls?

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:17.370
I guess those two black-robed men
are related to the Hall of Souls.

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:22.340
The Hall of Souls...

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:25.940
The Hall of Souls...

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:30.940
I heard about it in the clan
when I was young.

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:32.780
But no way.

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:34.220
Wasn't the Hall of Souls

00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:36.100
wiped out a long time ago?

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:37.300
Right.

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:39.130
They've been out of sight for years.

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:41.700
But the Black Submerged Army has been
investigating their movements.

00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:43.130
We've received intelligence

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:44.940
that they've appeared
in the Jia Ma Empire.

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:49.860
So they've infiltrated Jia Nan Academy?

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:51.490
Yes.

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:56.490
The tower opening ceremony
is in the next few days.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.290
The Hall of Souls is targeting
the Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower?

00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:02.770
The Heavenly Flames, Fallen Heart Flame,
of Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower.

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:04.460
To get the Heavenly Flames?

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:06.860
If they took action at this moment,

00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:09.170
Jia Nan Academy
would be in for a great calamity.

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:47.170
Firmament Fruit, Syrup of Longevity,

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:48.860
Evergreen Vine.

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:56.940
Fire and Ice Dragon Beard Fruit
for now.

00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:26.290
The control of the fire

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:29.460
is the key to refining the elixir.

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:31.100
A little too much fire

00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:33.580
will turn the whole pot into ashes,
and all the work will be wasted.

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:35.010
A little less fire

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:37.100
will spoil the herbs
and you won't get anything.

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:40.370
To control the fire,

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:43.290
you need strong spiritual perception.

00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:48.900
Refine.

00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:18.530
You're running low on Dou Qi.

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:22.740
The Firmament Longevity Pill
is a grade 6 elixir.

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:25.010
It's too much for you to make it alone.

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:26.160
If you continue to refine it,

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:27.580
it will be too much of a drain on you.

00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:29.530
As long as I can save my brother,

00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:31.740
no matter what the cost is,

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:33.770
I will refine this elixir.

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:40.490
The yin and yang
of the Fire and Ice Dragon Beard Fruit

00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:43.060
are mutually exclusive.

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:47.530
The Green Lotus Core Flame
is neutral and peaceful.

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:49.980
Your Dou Qi is the most yang fire.

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:51.530
It lacks a cold fire.

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:53.820
That's why you can't digest
the Fire and Ice Dragon Beard Fruit.

00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:56.700
Cold fire?

00:28:58.100 --> 00:28:59.740
The only cold fire I know of

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:01.860
is the Bone Spirit Cold Fire.

00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:04.610
You don't have to do anything.

00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:07.290
Just lend me the Bone Spirit Cold Fire.

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:08.770
Bone Spirit Cold Fire
doesn't belong to you.

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:10.890
It's not always obedient
when you're at the controls.

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:12.060
If you can't hold out,

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:14.630
your meridians will be in danger
of being melted by Bone Spirit Cold Fire.

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:15.770
I can make it.

00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:01.010
Bone Spirit Cold Fire
is extreme yin and yang.

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:04.370
You have to endure the endless roasting
of fire in the Land of Eternal Day,

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:05.890
which is interchanged
with the drilling pain

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:08.010
of immutable metaphysical ice

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:09.410
in the Land of Extreme Cold.

00:30:09.530 --> 00:30:11.290
I don't know when it will end.

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:44.820
Refining elixir

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:47.010
is refining the heaven and the earth,

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:48.170
the mountains and the sea.

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:52.220
Grade 1 elixir for external injuries.

00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:55.340
Grade 2 elixir for internal injuries.

00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:58.290
Grade 3 elixir for transformation.

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:00.980
Grade 4 elixir for reveling ability.

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:04.100
Grade 5 elixir for a new level.

00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:07.490
Grade 6 elixir for Dou Emperor.

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:10.580
Grade 7 elixir for Dou Venerate.

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:13.620
Grade 8 elixir for heavenly calamity.

00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:16.530
Grade 9 elixir for watershed.

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:19.770
The Grade Emperor takes human form.

00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:22.490
An elixir

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:24.340
is not only used

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:26.460
to raise the level of Dou Practitioners,

00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:29.460
but also a nameless object
that saves people from danger.

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:32.700
The key to making an elixir

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:36.220
is sincerity.

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:44.370
No!

00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:45.610
Mr. Yao.

00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:47.980
The Fire and Ice Dragon Beard Fruit
is gone.

00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:52.700
You made it?

00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:54.490
Yes!

00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:16.850
That's it!

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:43.010
Wake up.

00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:58.310
Brother.

00:32:58.340 --> 00:32:59.180
Brother.

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:05.370
He woke up.

00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:07.610
Xun'er.

00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:15.730
Brat.

00:33:16.410 --> 00:33:18.490
I thought I'd never see you again.

00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:22.610
Brother.

00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:24.100
What happened?

00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:34.860
After the three-year appointment,

00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:36.220
you won over Nalan Yanran

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:38.170
fair and square.

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:41.700
But Yun Shan became enraged

00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:45.250
and hunted down the Xiao Clan.

00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:47.300
In the end,

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:50.570
in order to cover the retreat
of our second brother with the clan,

00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:53.620
Father

00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:56.180
was captured by them.

00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:57.420
Father was captured?

00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:58.500
I am sorry.

00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:00.340
It's all my fault.

00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:01.260
I...

00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:06.220
Misty Cloud Sect is trying
to wipe out the Xiao Clan.

00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:09.180
Brother.

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:13.140
Water.

00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:27.140
This is the Xiao Clan's ancient jade.

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:31.945
(Xiao Zhan, Xiao Yan's father)
It is linked to the bloodline

00:34:31.969 --> 00:34:33.920
(Xiao Zhan, Xiao Yan's father)
of all our patriarchs.

00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:37.180
The flickering light proves
that I am safe.

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:38.940
If I'm gone,

00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:41.380
this jade will make you

00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:43.420
the patriarch of the Xiao Clan.

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:48.660
This is the ancient jade
from Father.

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:50.700
The life of the current patriarch

00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:53.060
can be sensed on the ancient jade.

00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:58.060
The flickering of the light point indicates
that Father is still alive.

00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:00.220
Xiao Yan.

00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:03.060
This jade is not an ordinary one.

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:05.380
This is Tuoshe Ancient Emperor Jade.

00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:09.980
Tuoshe Ancient Emperor Jade?

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:15.780
When Father gave me the jade,

00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:18.060
he said it was a legacy
of the Xiao Clan

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:19.980
and only the patriarchs could have it.

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:22.380
Since it is a legacy
of the Xiao Clan's patriarchs,

00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:24.700
it might have a more important

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:26.060
meaning and function.

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:27.580
Xiao Yan.

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:29.100
Guard it well.

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:30.980
Don't show it to anyone.

00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:37.380
Father.

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:40.620
I will definitely get you out.
